      <p>This map is a product of a Sustainable Agricultural Lands Conservation Grant with the primary aim of identifying agricultural land that is in danger of being converted to be lost or land that has the potential to become new sites of agriculture–whether urban or rural. Alameda County Local Agency Formation Commission (Alameda LAFCO) with the support of the Alameda County Resource Conservation District (ACRCD) applied for and received this SALC Land Use Planning grant. You can review the final report of this project here: [INSERT LINK EVENTUALLY]</p>
      <p>In support of Alameda LAFCO and ACRCD’s overlapping interest in conserving agricultural land in Alameda County, the project had three related goals:</p>
      <ol type="A">
         <li><span class="underline">Identification and Preservation of Agricultural Lands including Working Lands</span> through identification of priority and critical areas for conservation.</li>
         <li><span class="underline">Infill Development Focused on Healthy and Resilient Communities for Disadvantaged and Low-Income Populations</span> by supporting urban agriculture and community gardens within city limits.</li>
         <li><span class="underline">Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions</span> by finding new areas for urban and rural agriculture in close proximity to residential areas, and conserving agricultural areas that reinforce urban growth boundaries both with land conservation measures, like easements, and with sustainable economic opportunities for agricultural producers.</li>

         The map was built to meet two of the primary objectives of this grant project:(1) to identify priority parcels of land to be conserved or developed into long-term agricultural use via acquisition or easement to reinforce urban growth boundaries and (2) to identify priority parcels of agricultural land or land that could be converted to agricultural use for new/future urban farms or community gardens within underserved communities. The final map is therefore meant to aid organizations and agencies in determining programmatic fit of specific parcels of land for certain grant programs while still being a useful tool for long-term agricultural conservation planning. The map can build highly customizable models that are based on the priorities of each user and/or a handful of grants that can facilitate agricultural land acquisition.
      </p>
      <p>This map is meant to help local agencies, planners, land trusts, and others explore agricultural and environmental characteristics of Alameda County to identify areas of Alameda County that may be high priorities for different policy goals and funding priorities. The interactive maps are designed to have someBasic Information that can be turned on and off including city limits, sphere of influence, Association of Bay Area Governments’ (ABAG) Growth Geographies, Williamson Act parcels, protected areas (e.g., parks), and parcels under conservation easements. Then there are four different models that can be customized based on four common grants that are used for acquiring agricultural land and developing conservation easements. Each model allows the user to prioritize each criteria on a 1 to 5 scale. The models, one for each grant, can highlight specific areas in Alameda County as priority agricultural areas. This can be helpful for planning purposes. Additionally, it is also possible for users to upload shapefiles of parcels to either map to see if a parcel falls into any of the priority areas for one of the four grants. Users can also compare grants for a given parcel to see which one would be most appropriate.</p>

      <div class='title' id="interactive">How the Interactive Web Map Works [ include screenshots when map is done]</div>
      <p>To help you evaluate the characteristics of the County relative to different planning and policy goals, a number of data layers have been brought together from existing data sources (see About the Data below). The layers include a range</p>
      <p>To allow the layers to be considered together, they have been spatially resampled into hexagonal planning units with an area of 160 acres, and scaled from 0-1. These units were constructed specifically for this Decision Support Tool for the purposes of combining the values of different data layers, and are not actual units used in standard planning processes. When viewing the map, you can adjust the weight of these layers on a scale of 0-5, which defines how much they contribute to the color of each hexagon.</p>
      <p>For many planning purposes, you don’t need to view all layers at once. Preset groups of layers have been prepared for common use cases, i.e., common land acquisition or conservation grants. For example if you are interested in seeing which areas of the county are most valuable for wildlife conservation, you can select the “WCB” preset which will display 7 layers related to wildlife.</p>
      <div class='title' id="map">Using the Interactive Web Map</div>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <span class="underline">General information</span>: The color-coding and composite numbers of each hexagon on the map are created by adding together the values of the weights for selected variable layers to create a composite score between 0 (for example, land that is not prioritized for agricultural conservation or development) to 1 (highest priority for agricultural conservation or development). The sum of the variable values is indicated in the planning units (1/4 mile hexagons). Planning units that are more conducive to agriculture (as determined by the user’s weighting of the variable layers) or the grant aims are closer to 1 and more green whereas variable values that are less prioritized are closer to 0 and more brown. The user can decide the importance of each visible variable by using the slider. By default, all variables are set to 1 at the start, indicating all variables in the set are of equal importance. Variables can be deemed unimportant or unnecessary to the composite score by sliding the value to 0. The maximum value for the variables is 5.
         </li>
         <li>The “Basic Information” subsection contains some variables that might be used for basic planning and/or might not have clear grant priority one way or another. For example, the data layer “Plan Bay Area Growth Geographies.” In some cases, areas of planned future development might be a poor choice for agriculture (e.g., might be areas with lots of construction or short-term pollution, parcel size is likely small, etc.) but on the other hand, these might be ideal areas to think about non-traditional agriculture (e.g., rooftop ag) or community gardens, given the likelihood of high housing-density and green space needs in these areas.</li>
         <li>Clicking on the top of the “Basic Information” bar will reveal the grants that can currently be modeled in the interactive web map, plus a list of all variables used in All grants (currently titled “All Layers”) which might be used for non-listed grant opportunities or for your own organizational planning purposes. There are currently 4 grants we have included. We have chosen specific variables for each grant based on each grants’ guidelines and data availability. When using the map to identify the value of a known parcel (uploaded by the user) to each grant, it is important to carefully choose the value of each variable. You can learn more information about each variable’s relationship to agricultural value and/or grant priority by hovering over the “i” icon next to each variable. You can also zoom in to specific areas to see composite priority scores overlaid on each hexagon.</li>
         <li>Looking at the opening page, the top row of tabs can be used to navigate between the map (“Interactive Web Map”), information about the data layers that were used to create the map (“Data Atlas”), if/how data were manipulated to be used in the map and models (“Documentation”; still under construction), and a place where the user can submit feedback about the maps once they are fully functional (“Feedback”).</li>
         <li>In the left bar there are 4 subsections. Clicking on the eye icon next to “Places, Roads and Highways” will turn off and on the city names, roads and highways. Clicking on the eye icon next to “Planning Units” will turn the modeled hexagons on and off. You can also click the list icon to the right of “Planning Units” to reveal the model color values e.g., hexagons that are more green indicate a higher priority for grant priority, whereas hexagons that are more brown indicate the opposite. Clicking the eye icon next to “Basic Info” will turn some informational layers on and off. You can also click the list icon to the right of “Basic Info” to view the individual layers and turn them on and off as well. The fourth subsection is where the user can build grant or other priority specific models. More explanation is below (“Building Models”).</li>
         <li>There are 4 icons within the map box. The + will zoom into the map whereas the – will zoom out. The house icon will bring you back to the standard map view where all of Alameda County is visible on the screen. The cloud with an arrow icon allows the user to upload their own zipped shapefile onto the map. KML and KMZ files are not supported. Once uploaded, a fourth subsection will appear on the left column called “Uploaded Shapefile” which allows the user to turn the highlighted area from the shapefile on and off. This function was created specifically to allow for land trusts and other conserving bodies to be able to view and weigh variables of interests in a parcel of land in question—for a grant or other purpose—and preserve the general privacy of landholders in Alameda County.</li>

         <summary class="detail">More Details<p><span class="detail"></span></summary>We selected land-cover types relevant to this tool and divided them into two categories and layers: Farming and Grazing. The farming, or crop-related, classes included Citrus and Subtropical, Deciduous, Field Crops, Grain and Hay, Truck Crops, Vineyard, and Young Perennial. The grazing layer included lands categorized as either Grazing or Pasture. We applied the same workflow for assigning both the Farming and Grazing layers to the Alameda County Hexagons. First, we utilized the Union tool in ArcGIS Pro to intersect the layers and their underlying data with the hexagons. The Union tool allowed us to see which hexagons did and did not intersect with the layers. Hexagons that had no overlap with the layers were automatically selected out and given a score of zero because areas without active farming or grazing are not likely to be suitable for future farming and grazing activities. Hexagons that did intersect with the layers were given a score of 1 because areas with active farming or grazing are more likely to be suitable for future farming and grazing activities. The final result was two hexagon layers, with each hexagon given a score of 1 or 0 depending on whether or not they intersected with the farming or grazing layers. </p>

Originally this data layer covered the entirety of the state of California, so using the Clip tool in ArcGIS Pro we confined the area to census tracts within Alameda County. We utilized the Union tool in ArcGIS Pro to intersect the layer with the hexagons. Hexagons that had no overlap with the layer were automatically selected out and given a score of 0. Hexagons that did intersect with the polygon were assigned a decimal value between 0-1 based on the share of each hexagon that did intersect with the census tracts. For example, if a hexagon intersected completely with a low-income census tract then that hexagon would be given a linear normalized score of 1, equivalent to 100%. Similarly, if only 50% of a hexagon intersected with a census tract then that hexagon would be given a linear normalized score of 0.50. Hexagons with higher scores are prioritized in this web app because low median incomes are often correlated with other community disadvantages, and these areas should be considered as priority areas for green spaces, including urban farms and gardens. </p>

         <summary class="detail">More Details<p><span class="detail"></span></summary>Each polygon in this data layer represents a buffer zone outside the city limits and inside the sphere of influence. For this layer, we utilized the Distance Allocation tool in ArcGIS Pro to create a distance raster. Smaller distance values represented closer proximity to the buffer zone and larger values represented farther proximity to the buffer zone, with the Alameda County boundary as the extent. Next, we ran the Zonal Statistics tool, with the Alameda County Hexagons layer as the Feature Zone parameter, to summarize these distance values by the hexagons. Because each cell from the distance raster was smaller than each of the individual hexagons, we decided to take the mean value of the raster cells within a given hexagon and attribute them to each hexagon. At this point, each hexagon had a mean distance value, where smaller mean distance values represented closer proximities to buffer zones and larger mean distance values represented farther proximities to buffer zones. The ultimate goal of this layer was to give higher values to areas near buffer zones because areas outside of city limits but within the sphere of influence of a city are more likely to be developed and thus have a greater risk of conversion to non-agricultural uses. To prioritize city limit proximity we needed areas within and nearby buffer zones to have linear normalized values moving towards 1 and areas increasingly further away from city boundaries to have linear normalized values moving towards 0. To achieve this result we took the mean distance assigned to each hexagon, divided it by the maximum of all mean values, subtracted that value by 1 and then took the absolute value so that we wouldn’t have any negative distance values. In the final result of this layer, hexagons within the buffer boundaries were given scores of 1, hexagons moving away from the boundaries were given scores linearly decreasing from 1, and the furthest hexagon from all buffer boundaries in Alameda County was given a score of 0. </p></details>

         <summary class="detail">More Details<p><span class="detail"></span></summary>Each polygon in the data layer represents a continuous urban growth boundary. Within Alameda County alone, there are 82 individual boundaries with varying sizes. We utilized the union tool in ArcGIS Pro to intersect the layer with the hexagons. Hexagons that had no overlap with the layer were given a score of zero. Hexagons that did overlap with the polygons were assigned a linear normalized score between 0-1 based on what percentage of their total area intersected with the growth boundary. For example, if 60% of a hexagon intersected with a growth boundary then that hexagon would be given a linear normalized score of 0.6. We chose to have these hexagon values be continuous along the edges of the growth boundaries to account for the variability of urban spread and to ensure prioritization could extend beyond presently urbanized areas.

We utilized the Union tool in ArcGIS Pro to intersect the wetlands layer with the hexagons. Hexagons that had no overlap with the layer were given a score of zero. Hexagons that did intersect with the layers  were given a normalized score of 1. We decided to prioritize hexagons that overlapped with wetlands because wetland areas are crucial both for species biodiversity and as important flood buffers. Although some wetland areas in the dataset were much smaller than the size of a given hexagon, we still wanted to prioritize hexagons with even a small amount of overlap because the areas surrounding wetlands are also likely beneficial for biodiversity and buffering floods. </p></details>

For this layer, we utilized the Distance Allocation tool in ArcGIS Pro to create a distance raster. Smaller distance values represented closer proximity to the city limits and larger values represented farther proximity to the city limits, with the Alameda County boundary as the extent. Next, we ran the Zonal Statistics tool, with the Alameda County Hexagons layer as the Feature Zone parameter, to summarize these distance values by the hexagons. Because each cell from the distance raster was smaller than each of the individual hexagons, we decided to take the mean value of the raster cells within a given hexagon and attribute them to each hexagon. At this point, each hexagon had a mean distance value, where smaller mean distance values represented closer proximities to city limits and larger mean distance values represented farther proximities to city limits. The ultimate goal of this layer was to give higher values to areas near city limits because these protections may reinforce and protect those limits in the future. To prioritize city limit proximity we needed areas within and nearby city limits to have linear normalized values moving towards 1 and areas increasingly further away from city boundaries to have linear normalized values moving towards 0. To achieve this result we took the mean distance assigned to each hexagon, divided it by the maximum of all mean values, subtracted that value by 1 and then took the absolute value so that we wouldn’t have any negative numbers. In the final result of this layer, hexagons within the city boundaries were given scores of 1, hexagons moving away from the boundaries were given scores linearly decreasing from 1, and the furthest hexagon from all city boundaries in Alameda County was given a score of 0. </p></details>

We joined the data table to a polygon with all the census tracts for Alameda County so that we could incorporate it into our web app spatially. At this point, each census tract had a Food Insecurity Index score, ranked from 1-5. We then utilized the Union tool in ArcGIS Pro to intersect the layer with the Alameda County Hexagons. Hexagons that did not intersect with the data layer, either because they were in the bay or overlapped with census tracts containing No Data, were given a score of 0. For hexagons that did overlap with the census tracts, we calculated the percent area each Alameda County hexagon intersected with a given Food Insecurity Index grade. Whichever ranking (1-5) had the most overlap with our hexagons was assigned that score. For example, if Hexagon X intersected 40% with a census tract ranked 3 and 60% with a census tract ranked 4, then Hexagon X would be assigned a ranking of 4. Overall, hexagons with a food insecurity ranking of 5 were normalized to 1; hexagons with a ranking of 4 were normalized to 0.8; hexagons with a ranking of 3 were normalized to 0.6; hexagons with a ranking of 2 were normalized to 0.4; hexagons with a ranking of 1 were normalized to 0.2; and lastly, hexagons with a ranking of zero were normalized to 0.  We chose to preserve the categorical rankings of the Food Insecurity Index because they were determined by combining a variety of metrics, including medicaid insurance enrollment, perceived health status, household expenditures, household income, and single-parent headed households. Prioritizing census tracts with greater need to address food insecurity is a priority of this web app because these areas could benefit from urban agricultural activities. </p></details>

First, we used the Clip tool in ArcGIS Pro to work only with the data available for Alameda County. Then, we vectorized the dataset using the Raster to Polygon tool, meaning we converted each of the raster cells into polygons while keeping the accompanying information. Next, we utilized the Union tool in ArcGIS pro to intersect the hexagon layer with the organic soil carbon stock polygons. Hexagons that did not intersect with the data layer were given a score of 0. Because multiple hexagons could fit within each soil carbon polygon, we decided to take the maximum value present in the intersection and attribute it to the hexagon. For example, if Hexagon X intersected with both Polygon A and with Polygon B, but Polygon A had a higher value, then Hexagon X would take the value of Polygon A. To normalize the values so that they would be continuous between 0 and 1, we set each hexagon equal to: its present value minus the minimum value of the dataset, divided by the maximum value minus the minimum value. If x is the present value of the hexagon, then the equation would be: (x – min(x)) / (max(x) – min(x)).

A score of 1 equates to very low species richness and a score of 5 equates to very high species richness. We utilized the Union tool in ArcGIS Pro to intersect the layer with the hexagons. Because the dataset covered the entire extent of Alameda County, the only instance where the layer did not intersect with the hexagons occurred in the San Francisco Bay and those hexagons were given a score of 0. The hexagons used by CDFW for the purpose of this layer were larger than the ones we used in our analysis. As a result, some of the Alameda County hexagons intersected with multiple hexagons from the species richness layer. We calculated the percent area each Alameda County hexagon intersected with a given species richness ranking. Whichever ranking (1-5) had the most overlap with our hexagons was assigned that score. For example, if Hexagon X intersected 40% with a polygon ranked 2 and 60% with a polygon ranked 5, then Hexagon X would be assigned a ranking of 5. We decided to preserve the categorial rankings of species richness from the original layer because they were based on relevant scientific groupings. Conserving habitats with greater numbers of native species is a priority of this web app, and therefore hexagons with a ranking of 5 were normalized to 1; hexagons with a ranking of 4 were normalized to 0.8; hexagons with a ranking of 3 were normalized to 0.6; hexagons with a ranking of 2 were normalized to 0.4; hexagons with a ranking of 1 were normalized to 0.2; and lastly, hexagons with a ranking of zero were normalized to 0. </p></details>

         A data layer published by the Natural Resources Conservation Service displaying the amount of water the top 150 cm of soil can store and become available to plants. In this layer, available water storage (AWS) was calculated from the difference between soil water content at field capacity and the stable wilting point adjusted for fragments and salinity. This dataset, which has AWS information for the entire United States, was developed to create water budgets, protect water resources, assess a soil’s capacity to support crops, among many other uses. This dataset was last updated in June of 2023.

         <summary class="detail">More Details<p><span class="detail"></span></summary>Each raster cell in this dataset has a value that describes the amount of water in cm that can be stored in the top 150 cm of soil, ranging from 0-150cm. First, we used the Clip tool in ArcGIS Pro to work only with the data available for Alameda County. Then we used the Zonal Statistics tool in ArcGIS pro to summarize the data values from the AWS layer by the Alameda County hexagons. Because multiple raster cells could fit within each hexagon, we decided to take the mean of the AWS values and assign that number to each individual hexagon unit. To normalize the mean AWS values so that they would be continuous between 0 and 1, we set each hexagon equal to: its present value minus the minimum value of the dataset, divided by the maximum value minus the minimum value. If x is the present mean value of the hexagon, then the equation would be: (x – min(x)) / (max(x) – min(x)). This equation gives us continuously normalized values between 0-1, where higher values mean that there is more AWS and lower values mean there is less AWS. Higher AWS values were prioritized because greater water storage capacity in the top 150 centimeters of soil makes the soil more suitable for many types of agriculture. </p></details>

         A layer published by the California Department of Conservation detailing lands protected by the California Land Conservation Act of 1965, otherwise known as the Williamson Act. The Act allows private landowners and municipal governments to form contractual partnerships for the purpose of restricting specific land parcels to agricultural or public open space use. This data layer summarizes and reflects recent data submitted to the California Department of Conservation by local planning agencies and/or assessor offices throughout the state. The layer is updated regularly, with the most recent changes made in April of 2023.

         <summary class="detail">More Details<p><span class="detail"></span></summary>Each polygon in this dataset represents an area of land protected under the Williamson Act. We utilized the Union tool in ArcGIS Pro to intersect the layer with the hexagons. Hexagons that had no overlap with Williamson Act parcels were given a score of 0. Hexagons that completely overlapped with the polygons were given a maximum score of 1. Hexagons that did overlap with the polygons were assigned a linear normalized score between 0-1 based on what percentage of their total area intersected with the parcels. For example, if 60% of a hexagon intersected with a Williamson Act parcel then that hexagon would be given a linear normalized score of 0.6. We chose to have these hexagon values be continuous along the edges of the parcel boundaries to maintain prioritization near Williamson Act parcels, which may contribute to preserving larger, contiguous spaces.</p></details>
